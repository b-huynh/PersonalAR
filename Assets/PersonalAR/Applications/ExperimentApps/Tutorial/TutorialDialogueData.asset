  - text: 'Welcome to Layerable AR!


      This tutorial will guide you through
      the various features of the Layerable AR system.

      To continue, press
      the Continue button with your finger.'

  - text: "This system presents simulated examples of AR applications you might use
      in a personal augmented reality future. Let\u2019s take a look at each one.
      \n\nFirst open the Code Entry app."
    audioClip: {fileID: 8300000, guid: 89f50f624d15328428cc088fedee60f3, type: 3}
  - text: 'The Code Entry app allows you to type pin codes and passwords. In the
      future you might use this to open digital door locks or quickly connect to
      wireless networks.


      Open Item Inspector next.'
    audioClip: {fileID: 8300000, guid: 1807c5fff6aecfb49afafd0bc01fc9da, type: 3}
  - text: 'The Item Inspector app allows you to inspect supported objects to learn
      more about them, like manufacturing date or serial numbers.


      Open Device
      Groups next.'
    audioClip: {fileID: 8300000, guid: e0a1ead6ddd6ec747b3e9faeee121610, type: 3}
  - text: "Device Groups allows you to wirelessly connect objects to each other.
      This is useful for transferring data or turning a group of objects on and off.
      \n\nOpen Atlas next."
    audioClip: {fileID: 8300000, guid: 60bf2d888cb9a314a995ca8010f4ed55, type: 3}
  - text: "Atlas is a 3D map of Earth where you can learn about major cities and
      other landmarks. \n\nThese are the 4 app simulations you will be using for
      this experiment.\r"

  - text: Currently, LayerableAR is in Layerable mode. This allows you to open and
      close as many apps as you want, though they may sometimes overlap.
    audioClip: {fileID: 8300000, guid: 8a2a38aadc1407347b5ade95f84ee2f1, type: 3}
  - text: You can switch between Layerable or Immersive mode in the hand menu. In
      Immersive mode, apps open one at a time and will automatically close the previous
      app. Your experimenter will instruct you on when to switch modes.

  - text: 'Your task throughout this experiment will be to enter as many 6-digit
      codes as possible in the Code Entry app. '
    audioClip: {fileID: 8300000, guid: 043b2a8c56b6cfb48a70e3fc928a0678, type: 3}
  - text: The codes are broken up into 3 sets of 2 digits identified by 2 letters
      and distributed between each app. To find one code, you will need to look for
      the same sequence of letters throughout all three apps.

  - text: Find and enter one code in the Code Entry app. You can enter the code fragments
      you find in any order. For example, if your fragments are SC-98, SC-22, and
      SC-04, you may enter 98, 22, and 04 in the Code Entry in any order.
